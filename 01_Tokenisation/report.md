# Segmentation and Tokenisation Report
The two segmenters I am using for the comparison are the pragmatic segmenter (which can be found at [pragmatic](https://github.com/diasks2/pragmatic_segmenter)) and the Punkt segmenter from NLTK (which can be found at [punkt](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/tokenize/punkt.html)).

The pragmatic segmenter is a rule-based sentence boundary detection system.  The pragmatic segmenter is made to work across multiple different languages even when the format and domain is unknown.  The pragmatic segmenter does not use any machine-learning techniques.  Additionally, the pragmatic segmenter is opinionated and made for the express purpose of segmenting text to create translation memories.  In practice this means that items such as parenthesis within a sentence are kept as one segment, even if there are technically two or more sentences within the segment.  Additionally, if the segmenter comes across an ambiguous sentence boundary it will ignore it rather than splitting it.  The pragmatic segmenter _does_ use regular expression and it is written in Ruby.  Of the 58 sentences 50 sentence boundaries were detected correctly, making the accuracy percentage 86.2%.  The sentences that the pragmatic segmenter got wrong were sentences that included dates (ej. Hin 4.) and sentences that included the abbreviations for "approx." (uml.), both parts for the abbreviation for "B.C." (f.Kr.), and "including" (m.a.Ã­).

The punkt segmenter divides a text into a list of sentences by using an unsupervised learning algorithm to build a model for abbreviations, collocations, and words that start a sentence.  The punkt segmenter _must_ be trained on a large collection of text from the target language before it can be used.  The punkt segementer _does_ use regular expressions and it is written in Python.  Of the 58 sentences 53 sentence boundaries were detected correcently, making the accuracy percentage 91.4%. The sentences that the punkt segmenter got wrong were sentences that included the abbreviations for "approx." (uml.) and just the latter part of the abbreviation for "B.C." (f.Kr.).
